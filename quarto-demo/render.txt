### âœ… To Render the Report

Once your dev container is up and running:

- In **VS Code**: open `example.qmd`, then click **"Render"**
- In **RStudio Server** (http://localhost:8787): open the file and click **Render**

Quarto will output an HTML report in the same directory.

### ðŸ§© Tip

If you use GitHub Pages or Netlify, you can deploy this as part of a website by adding `quarto.yml`.

Let me know if you'd like to convert this to a full Quarto website, integrate Stan results into the report, or export to PDF!
